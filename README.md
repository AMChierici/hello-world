hello-world
===========

My first repo on GitHub

I love :coffee:, :pizza:, and :dancer:. Of course I'm Italian, in fact I also love shirts (Zegna - made to measure, please), suits (Brioni - I will afford it one day) and the Duomo di Milano.
Accidentally, I also love bulding new ventures, computer science research, Machine Learning, R and Python too...
